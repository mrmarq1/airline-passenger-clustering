# Airline Passenger Clustering
Model to help identify segments from airline passenger data. To apply several clustering technqiues to data to assess optimal approach and determine keys segments.

## Data cleaning
- Conducted analyses to understand the dataset and clean it, handling outliers, dropping redundant features and stanardising it in the process.
- Applied PCA to reduce feature space and eliminate multicollinearity.

Modelling
- Applied KNN clustering using the elbow technqiue and silhouette plotting to determine the optimal cluster number.
- Comapred KNN with DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Model and Mean Shift approaches.

Plotting and analysis
- Analysed best performing model to determine breakdown of segments.
